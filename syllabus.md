# Teaching methods

The course will utilize a combination of frontal lectures and hands-on exercise sessions.

The course will maintain a balance of approximately 40% frontal lectures and 60% hands-on sessions.

The course is designed to be highly interactive, with ample opportunities for students to ask questions and engage in discussions during both the frontal lectures and hands-on sessions.

---

# Verification of learning

Students will be assigned a final homework project to complete individually. Students are expected to submit the code and deliver a brief presentation, supported by slides, outlining their proposed solution and design choices.

The maximum achievable grade is 30. Honors may be granted in exceptional cases.

# Books and material

The instructor will provide support material and references throughout the course. In addition, there are many free online resources available to supplement the course material.

For students who prefer to read books, the following references are recommended:

1. Parallel and High Performance Programming with Python, Fabio Nelly, Orange AVA, April 2023.
2. Python Parallel Programming Cookbook, Giancarlo Zaccone, Packt Publishing, September 2019.
3. High Performance Python: Practical Performant Programming for Humans, Micha Gorelick & Ian Ozvald, O'Reilly, May 2020.

These books provide in-depth coverage of the course material and can serve as valuable resources for further study.

# Extra info

Students are required to have an active SISSA account enabled for the use of Ulysses. Please refer to the following links for further instructions: https://www.itcs.sissa.it/services/computing/hpc, https://ulysses.readthedocs.io/.

To participate in this course, students will be requested to bring their own laptop equipped with a working Linux or UNIX environment, whether standalone or virtualized. Students are expected to utilize either a text editor, such as Emacs, Vim, or Nano, or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as VSCode.

To ensure that their system is suitable for the course, students should verify that the following software is installed.

- Python 3. The presence of Jupyter and conda is recommended.
- A C++ compiler installed with full support for C++17, such as GCC 10 or newer, or Clang 11 or newer.
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Please follow the instruction on the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and the [post-installation steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) thoroughly.

Any recent Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu 22.04 or newer, or Debian 11 or newer, or macOS system that meets these requirements should be suitable for the course.

Windows users may consider installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
